# Unity 2017 Game Development Essentials - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Unity 2017 Game Development Essentials - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-2017-game-development-essentials-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469397), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
I assume that you are confident with modern programming; it's better if you have some previous experience with C#, but it's not mandatory. Decent knowledge of computer graphics in general and an interest in learning are a must. We suggest you to install The Gimp for editing textures and sprites, and Blender for editing 3D models.
Despite the difficulty they might have at start, they are very complete packages with nothing to envy of packages such as Photoshop or Maya. Of course, this is your call; if you are already a Photoshop guru or Maya expert, there is no need to tell you to keep using your favorite package!
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
bool grounded = false; 
float speed; 
   
  void Update(){ 
    if(grounded==true){
        speed = 5.0f;
    } 
  } 
```

This book is intended for beginners and intermediate users and game developers in general. No previous Unity experience is needed, but some basic knowledge about programming is required to get to grip with C#.
